  Within SIEMENS,
  \alert<2>{constraint technologies} have been successfully used for solving configuration problems for more than \alert<2>{25 years}.
  % By the application of constraints we were able to significantly reduce not only the development effort but also
  % maintenance costs compared to procedural or rule-based systems.
  % In cases where we could compare similar configuration systems,
  [...]
  approximately \alert<2>{80 percent} of the \alert<2>{maintenance costs} and
  more than \alert<2>{60 percent} of the \alert<2>{development costs} for the knowledge representation and reasoning tasks were saved.
